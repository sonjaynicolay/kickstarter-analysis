# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
##Analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover Trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis will explore and breakdown the success and failure of plays based on their campaign outcomes. The campaign outcomes have been broken down and determined specifically through the success in relation to their launch date and funding goals achieved as documented in the Kickstart Dataset provided.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to explain and give Louisa a visualization as to how her play fared in comparison to other plays.
## Analysis and Challenges
Looking at the Dataset there are some factors that may make the results a bit skewed/ challenging. First we didn't separate by country or region. New York,New York is more likely to have more people attending a play increasing its chances of success versus a city or town such as Greenville, Alabama. We also are not able to see the age of attendees or if the plays have specific age ranges they project to. This would also challenge some of the findings and also help us better understand why plays are or are not successful. Not that pandemics happen often but the effects of flu season and other mild illnesses within countries would help us understand if certain seasons weren't a great choice to Kickstart a play.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the launch date data, January showed the most cancelled, while May and July showed the most failed. May-July saw a spike in successful plays with 3 months of the highest success rates. February & August also showed respectable numbers coming with the next highest success numbers. Based on launch date alone about 61% of the plays were a success, 36% failed and 3% were cancelled.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Even with a quick glance, it doesn't take much to notice that those who set smaller goals, were more successful. A little over 66% were successful based of goals, and about 33% failed. People tend to know their crowds and markets and seem to have a good understand as to the what those markets will bring to their plays. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
In breaking down the data, I had a few challenges understanding some of the formulas amd processes. More so because I haven't used a formula or anything over a basic math skill since at minimum 2014. When I researched for answers through Google and Youtube, I often became a bit more confused because each example was extremely different. I needed a solid understanding of the process first then a tutorial on all the ways it could be done, and I kind of got the opposite resultign in hours of me staring at the screen, harassing people and becoming mind numb, but now I have I have it, and now you are able to read this awesome analysis with some solid information.
## Results
In conclusion, I'm not sure this exactly is the information Louisa is looking for. If I were her I would want a list of the specific plays with their goals vs what they made and their launch date. The analysis we did gave Louisa and us more of an oversight of the number of plays that were or were not successful over the course of a specific amount of time. Majority of the plays were successful. 
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Those who launched in Summer had a greater chance of larger success but also a larger risk of failing.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Those who set smaller goals were were successful.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It doesn't breakdown city or region within the countries, It also doesn't include target market.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 We could create a table breaking down the specific plays by name and country
 We could compare goals to what was actaully made
